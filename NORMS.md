## Group Norms:

#### Roles

- GitMaster
- TaskMaster

#### Daily Process:

10 AM
Check in around 4PM

### Disagreements and Frustration:

- Group comfort with using a new technology is important.
- Pros and cons list, everyone involved, last case ask alec for input if its a technology choice.
- Everyone’s input is important, but Majority rules.
- Take a break
- Be supportive and understanding.
- Be respectful, if someone has an issue with another team member talk with that person about it respectfully.
- Ask for help sooner rather than later
- Communicate openly

### Merges

- Taken care of by GitMaster
- Adhering to Contribution Guidelines will keep the merge conflicts away!

### Asking for Help:

- if a group member is struggling with a task they should tell the group.
- If we’ve already asked for help within the group, and everyone is stumped, it’s ok to ask for instructor assistance!

### Pairing:

- Pairs decide how they want to accomplish tasks.
- Switch after completing a requirement, component, etc
- Partners should switch off 45-90 min, breaking in between.

### Work After Hours

- It’s ok to keep working on something minor in your free time
- Morning merge meeting as part of the stand up
- Respect different workflows.
- If taking on a new task from our "todos", Communicate with the group and the taskMaster, so that they can update the project board and the group knows what you're working on.
- Be aware of what files are being worked on by others.
- Don't expect the gitmaster to approve pull requests after normal hours.
- Talk about what we’ve been doing to stay on the same page.
- Try and find discrete components or parts that you can work on if you do want to work asynchronously to minimize conflicts
