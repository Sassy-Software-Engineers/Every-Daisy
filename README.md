## project board best practices

# For Collaborators: 
- when you're assigned a task, it should be in the _"Todo"_ status group. 
- update your status from todo to _"in progress"_ when you begin working on a task. 

# git checkout -b [newBranchName]
- _BranchName_ : 
should be descriptive and short and related to the title of the issue you're working on. 
_commit messages_: 
for your final commit before placing a pull request - it should be the #same name as the title of the issue or it should reference the issue #
