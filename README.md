## project board best practices

# For Collaborators:

- when you're assigned a task, it should be in the _"Todo"_ status group.
- update your status from todo to _"in progress"_ when you begin working on a task.
  \_Be cognizant of updating your status, and add any relevant comments to your task. i.e. something's not working - change the status to "bug" and be concise and clear about the problem, where it occurs, and suggested solution if any.

# git checkout -b [newBranchName]

- _BranchName_ :
  should be descriptive and short and related to the title of the issue you're working on.

_commit messages_:
for your final commit before placing a pull request - it should have the same title as your issue (task) or you can manually link it, see the link below for linking a PR to an issue.
\*\* you can change the title of the issue to make it shorter and then add in the description what it was.
