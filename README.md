### FSA suggested Group Work:

#### Group Work

In this project, you will work in teams of 4. In a team of four people A B C D, there are 3 unique pairing combinations: AB CD, AC BD, AD BC. As you work through the project, please continue to switch pairs on a feature by feature basis. If a feature is taking more than two days, please consult your assigned fellow or an instructor.

Use Git to manage your project, and GitHub for easy collaboration. As needed, meet as a team to decide on the next reachable goals for your project and split them into achievable tasks. For a given task, we recommend the following workflow.
