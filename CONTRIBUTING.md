- The group is responsible for coming up with descriptions for new tasks that need to be done when we have our standup and TaskMaster will create the new tasks.
- members are responsible for looking at requirements and coming up with ideas.
- members should be aware that Git Master and Task Master are coding & keeping up with their extra responsibilities.

## Expectations

### Group Members:

- git-hygiene aware.
- Update their task with comments and status:
  - Being clear and concise and understandable.
  - It should be easy for other group members to easily understand what you're working on and its status by looking at the project board.
- link issue to pull request when initiating "Compare and Pull" in github.
- Refer to github docs [here](./README.md) And first try to figure out how to properly complete your task.
  -Then Ask gitMaster for help on this after that if you’re still unsure.
  **Goal should be to keep Project board up to date so that we aren't communicating about project issues through discord and slack.**
  _Suggestion_: Using Git discussions on Grace Shopper Repo

### GitMaster:

- is in charge of approving PR and checking that PR is linked to issue.
- Can reject PR if it is not properly linked to the issue and/or is in some way incomplete/unclear gitMaster can make comment “missing issue reference” etc and send it back to the member.
- GitMaster should not have to do more than ensuring the git workflow is clean and well kept.
- Someone else will approve git Master’s pull requests.

### TaskMaster

- Responsible for assigning new tasks and double checking that group members are updating their status.
- Task Master should also not have to do more than making sure people have tasks.
