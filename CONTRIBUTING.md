- The group is responsible for coming up with descriptions for new tasks that need to be done when we have our standup and TaskMaster will create the new tasks.
- members are responsible for looking at requirements and coming up with ideas.
- members should be aware that Git Master and Task Master are coding & keeping up with their extra responsibilities.

## Expectations

### Group Members:

- git-hygiene aware.
- Update their task with comments and status:
  - Being clear and concise and understandable.
  - It should be easy for other group members to easily understand what you're working on and its status by looking at the project board.

- link issue to pull request when initiating "Compare and Pull" in github.
  [See](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- Refer to github doc links provided [here](./README.md) And first try to figure out how to properly complete your task.
  - Then Ask gitMaster for help on this if you're still unclear.
    **Goal**
  - Keep Project board up to date so that we aren't communicating about project issues through discord and slack, and someone misses a communication.
    _Suggestion_: Using Git discussions on Grace Shopper Repo

### GitMaster:

- In charge of approving Pull Requests and checking that PR is linked to issue.
- Can reject PR if it is not properly linked to the issue and/or is in some way incomplete/unclear.
  - Can include helpful comment like “missing issue reference”, but it is ultimately up to members to follow guidelines and included needed references.
- GitMaster should not have to do more than Review Code, and ensure the git workflow is clean and well kept.
- Someone else will approve gitMaster’s pull requests.

- link issue to pull request when initiating "Compare and Pull" in github. [see_this_link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- Refer to github docs [here](./README.md) And first try to figure out how to properly complete your task.
  -Then Ask gitMaster for help on this after that if you’re still unsure.
  **Goal should be to keep Project board up to date so that we aren't communicating about project issues through discord and slack.**
  _Suggestion_: Using Git discussions on Grace Shopper Repo


### TaskMaster

- Responsible for assigning new tasks and double checking that group members are updating their status.

- Is in charge of the Project Board.
- Should call out members _kindly_ who are not following the guidelines and updating their status, members are aware this is expected but everyone forgets sometimes.
- Task Master should also not have to do more than making sure people have tasks and creating new Tasks.
